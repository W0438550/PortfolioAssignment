			<h3>Profile</h3>
			<p>Hello, my name is Soojhawon Siddhart. Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>
			<p>I am a young enterprising professional whose main goal is to keep learning about technologies and innovative trends of the Information Technology sector by building up my network and acquiring industry standard skills. </p>
			<p>I like to take part in competitions where I can work in a team to showcase my skills as well as learn from the other members. I have taken part in the Innovation Challenge organized by IBM and RBC and won the housing category.</p>
			<p>Volunteering is second nature to me. During my 2 years of school, I participated twice in the event planning of the school's annual IT Job Fair.</p>
